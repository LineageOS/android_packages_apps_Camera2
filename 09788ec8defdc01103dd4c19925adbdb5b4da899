      "message": "Ethan, the logic is valid only when the camera is secure. Basically, when or not the logic is valid is if the adapter is a FixedLastDataAdapter or CameraDataAdapter, which depends in the mSecureCamera flag. CameraDataAdaptar only counts images, but FixedLastDataAdapter gives an space for the image that hold its settings. So we have to consider the current adapter to fix it.",
